# Simulation-of-Wireless-Channel-Models-BER-Analysis
This project simulates and evaluates digital communication systems over AWGN, Rayleigh, and Rician channels. BPSK, QPSK, and QAM are implemented, and performance is analyzed using BER vs. SNR. MATLAB simulations compare the effects of noise, fading, and line-of-sight on transmission reliability.
